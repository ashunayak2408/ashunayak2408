<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Ashutosh Nayak</h1>
<h3 align="center">SDET | Automation Framework Engineer | CI/CD & Cloud-Driven Quality Advocate</h3>

- 🚀 I design and maintain scalable automation frameworks using TypeScript with Playwright and API automation using Rest-Assured (Java) to ensure reliable and high-performance test coverage.
- 📈 I implement performance testing strategies using JMeter to validate system scalability, identify bottlenecks, and ensure optimal application responsiveness under load.
- 🔄 I integrate UI, API, and performance test suites into CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitLab to accelerate release cycles and improve deployment confidence.
- 🐳 I leverage containerization (Docker) and AWS-based cloud environments to enable scalable, distributed, and resilient test execution.
- 🧩 I focus on clean architecture, structured logging, parallel execution, and maintainable framework design to build long-term automation solutions.
- 🤝 I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to embed quality engineering into the software delivery lifecycle.

- 🌱 Currently expanding expertise in **Agentic AI and intelligent automation systems** to build smarter, self-adaptive testing solutions.
